We made an AI that can play TicTacToe to make sure the technique we are going to use on the Chess AI works properly. Even though the rules of the games are different, we will use the exact same methods and members with similar functioning. The most relevant advancement we have made is the Node class (which is nested in the AI class). The AI is able to analyze the ~300 thousand (9!) possible games of TicTacToe and plays in 3 seconds and plays perfectly. 

1. a class definition - File Game, class Game in line 3
2. a second class definition - File AI, class AI in line 
3. a third class definition - File AI, class Node (nested in class AI) in line 78
4. a struct definition - pending
5. an enumerated type - pending
6. inheritance - pending
7. polymorphism - pending
8. a second example of polymorphism - pending
9. throwing an exception and properly catching it - File Game, Line 85
10. definition of your own generic datatype - pending
11. properties - done
12. a static member function - there are many, see lines 16 and 50 in AI to see important methods
13. an interface - pending
14. a second interface - pending
15. use of at least two of the built-in generic collection types - one pending, one done in file Game, line 83
